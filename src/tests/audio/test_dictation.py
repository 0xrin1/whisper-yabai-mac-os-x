"""
Dedicated test for the dictation functionality including the complete flow:
1. Default dictation mode (no trigger required)
2. Optional dictation triggers (e.g., 'type', 'dictate')
3. Transcription of spoken text
4. Verification of text input via AppleScript

This test aligns with the current architecture where:
- Dictation is the default mode
- 'jarvis' trigger activates Code Agent mode
- System handles both modes appropriately
